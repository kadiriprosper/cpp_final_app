## Definition:
To run the body countinously untill a required condition is fullfill is called looping.

When the condition will become 'false' the execution of loop will be stopped.

### Syntax

![](resource:assets/images/C++/img24.png)


1. In 'for loop' there are three part: initialization, condition and increment/decrement
2. Initialization part executes only once
3. All the three part of 'for loop' are optional 


### Example

```
    #include<iostream>
    int main()
    {
        for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
        {
            cout<<i<<"\n";
        }
    }


    /*
    ### Output ###
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10

    */
```

In the above program, 'i' is a variable which is initialized with 1, condition goes to 10 and it is incremented by 1.

So the output will be 1 to 10.
