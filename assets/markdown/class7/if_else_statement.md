- **Example**


    ```
    #include<iostream>
    int main()
    {
        // Assign value to the variable 
        int x=50,y=20;
        // checking the condition
        if(x==y)
        {
            cout<<"x is equal to y";
        }
        else
        {
            cout<<"x is not equal to y";
        }
    }


    /*
    ### Output ###
    // In the above program condition is 'false' because te value of x=50 and y=20 and they are not equal, so 'else' part will execute

    x is not equal to y
    */
